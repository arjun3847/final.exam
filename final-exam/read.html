 						<h3>What is Consignment?</h3>
 						<p>Consigning with us would mean offering your product to be sold on our website for a minimal fee. For example if you had a pair of shoes ( we also consign new clothing ) and were worth 200$. If you had a hard time selling these shoes for any reason you can come to us and we will post your product(s) on our website and if they sell through our website we keep 5% of the sale and the owner keeps 95%. The consignment process is simple and is simbiotic as both parties expierence positivity. To begin the process the buyer selects the price on his or her item and then they will proceed to send us detailed pictures of the product. Then we will update the pictures onto our webpage and we take over from there with advertisement etc. We will then alert the buyer when the item is purchased. </p>

 						<h3>What can you Consign?</h3>

 						<p>As of now you can consign all shoes any sizes including grade school, mens and womens sizes and in any conditon. The shoes can be of any brand ( Nike Adidas Timberland Gucci etc.) We will accept pretty much any kind of shoes in all sizes colors and conditions. Original Box and contents are not required and the buyer will always have the freedom to set their price. However Until we expand we will only be accepting brand new clothing with tags; Furthermore, we will accept men and womens clothing in adult sizes only in all brands.  </p>
 				 		
 				 		<h3>Why Should you Consign with us?</h3>

 						<p>Lots of places offer consignment but our process is just more efficient and safe. To begin most places cannot offer a 95 to 5 percent ratio from consigner to owner the ratio is typically 85 to 15 or 90 to 10. We are not a commerical store therefore you do not need to give us your product or even meet us face to face until your product has sold assuring safety. You do not need to do any work involving selling your shoes after you send us your intial email making it a carefree process. There are numerous reasons that consigning with us is a good idea.</p>
